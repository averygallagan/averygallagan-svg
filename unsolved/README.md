# averygallagan-svg
week 10 svg generator

This week our challenge was to create a command line application that would create a simple svg logo. When a user runs node index.js in the terminal they are prompted with questions asking for Text, text color, shape, and shape color. After these answers are submitted, a logo is generated in a new file and can be opened in the browser.
